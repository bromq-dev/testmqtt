# 4.2 Network Connections

The MQTT protocol requires an underlying transport that provides an ordered, lossless, stream of bytes from the Client to Server and Server to Client.

**Non normative comment**

The transport protocol used to carry MQTT 3.1 was TCP/IP as defined in \[[RFC793](#RFC793)\]. TCP/IP can be used for MQTT 3.1.1. The following are also suitable:

- TLS [\[RFC5246\]](#RFC5246)

- WebSocket [\[RFC6455\]](#RFC6455)

**Non normative comment**

TCP ports 8883 and 1883 are registered with IANA for MQTT TLS and non TLS communication respectively.

Connectionless network transports such as [User Datagram Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol "User Datagram Protocol") (UDP) are not suitable on their own because they might lose or reorder data.
