# 4.4 Message delivery retry

When a Client reconnects with CleanSession set to 0, both the Client and Server MUST re-send any unacknowledged PUBLISH Packets (where QoS > 0) and PUBREL Packets using their original Packet Identifiers \[MQTT-4.4.0-1\]. This is the only circumstance where a Client or Server is REQUIRED to redeliver messages.

**Non normative comment**
Historically retransmission of Control Packets was required to overcome data loss on some older TCP networks. This might remain a concern where MQTT 3.1.1 implementations are to be deployed in such environments.
