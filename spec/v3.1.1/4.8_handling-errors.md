# 4.8 Handling errors

Unless stated otherwise, if either the Server or Client encounters a protocol violation, it MUST close the Network Connection on which it received that Control Packet which caused the protocol violation \[MQTT-4.8.0-1\].

A Client or Server implementation might encounter a Transient Error (for example an internal buffer full condition) that prevents successful processing of an MQTT packet.

If the Client or Server encounters a Transient Error while processing an inbound Control Packet it MUST close the Network Connection on which it received that Control Packet \[MQTT-4.8.0-2\]. If a Server detects a Transient Error it SHOULD NOT disconnect or have any other effect on its interactions with any other Client.
