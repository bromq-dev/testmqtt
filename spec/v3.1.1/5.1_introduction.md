# 5.1 Introduction

This Chapter is provided for guidance only and is **Non Normative**. However, it is strongly recommended that Server implementations that offer TLS [\[RFC5246\]](#RFC5246) SHOULD use TCP port 8883 (IANA service name: secure-mqtt).

There are a number of threats that solution providers should consider. For example:

- Devices could be compromised
- Data at rest in Clients and Servers might be accessible
- Protocol behaviors could have side effects (e.g. `timing attacks`)
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Communications could be intercepted, altered, re-routed or disclosed
- Injection of spoofed Control Packets

MQTT solutions are often deployed in hostile communication environments. In such cases, implementations will often need to provide mechanisms for:

- Authentication of users and devices
- Authorization of access to Server resources
- Integrity of MQTT Control Packets and application data contained therein
- Privacy of MQTT Control Packets and application data contained therein

As a transport protocol, MQTT is concerned only with message transmission and it is the implementer`s responsibility to provide appropriate security features. This is commonly achieved by using TLS [\[RFC5246\]](#RFC5246).

In addition to technical security issues there could also be geographic (e.g. U.S.-EU SafeHarbor [\[USEUSAFEHARB\]](#USEUSAFEHARB)), industry specific (e.g. PCI DSS [\[PCIDSS\]](#PCIDSS)) and regulatory considerations (e.g. Sarbanes-Oxley [\[SARBANES\]](#SARBANES)).
