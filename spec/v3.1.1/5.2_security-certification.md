# 5.2 MQTT solutions: security and certification

An implementation might want to provide conformance with specific industry security standards such as NIST Cyber Security Framework \[[NISTCSF\]](#NISTCSF), PCI-DSS [\[PCIDSS\]](#PCIDSS)), FIPS-140-2 [\[FIPS1402\]](#FIPS1402) and NSA Suite B \[[NSAB](#NSAB)\].

Guidance on using MQTT within the NIST Cyber Security Framework \[[NISTCSF\]](#NISTCSF) can be found in the MQTT supplemental publication, MQTT and the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity [\[MQTT NIST\]](#MQTTSupplementalPublication). The use of industry proven, independently verified and certified technologies will help meet compliance requirements.
