# 7.1 Conformance Targets

### 7.1.1 MQTT Server

An MQTT Server conforms to this specification only if it satisfies all the statements below:

1 . The format of all Control Packets that the Server sends matches the format described in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3.

2 . It follows the Topic matching rules described in Section 4.7.

3 . It satisfies all of the MUST level requirements in the following chapters that are identified except for those that only apply to the Client:

- Chapter 1 - Introduction

- Chapter 2 - MQTT Control Packet format

- Chapter 3 - MQTT Control Packets

- Chapter 4 - Operational behavior

- Chapter 6 - (if MQTT is transported over a WebSocket connection)

- Chapter 7 - Conformance Targets

A conformant Server MUST support the use of one or more underlying transport protocols that provide an ordered, lossless, stream of bytes from the Client to Server and Server to Client [MQTT-7.1.1-1 ]. However conformance does not depend on it supporting any specific transport protocols. A Server MAY support any of the transport protocols listed in Section 4.2, or any other transport protocol that meets the requirements of [MQTT-7.1.1-1].

### 7.1.2 MQTT Client

An MQTT Client conforms to this specification only if it satisfies all the statements below:

1. The format of all Control Packets that the Client sends matches the format described in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3.

2. It satisfies all of the MUST level requirements in the following chapters that are identified except for those that only apply to the Server:

- Chapter 1 - Introduction

- Chapter 2 - MQTT Control Packet format

- Chapter 3 - MQTT Control Packets

- Chapter 4 - Operational behavior

- Chapter 6 - (if MQTT is transported over a WebSocket connection)

- Chapter 7 - Conformance Targets

A conformant Client MUST support the use of one or more underlying transport protocols that provide an ordered, lossless, stream of bytes from the Client to Server and Server to Client [MQTT-7.1.2-1 ]. However conformance does not depend on it supporting any specific transport protocols. A Client MAY support any of the transport protocols listed in Section 4.2, or any other transport protocol that meets the requirements of [MQTT-7.1.2-1 ].
