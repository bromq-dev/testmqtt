# 7 Conformance

The MQTT specification defines conformance for MQTT Client implementations and MQTT Server implementations.

An MQTT implementation MAY conform as both an MQTT Client and MQTT Server implementation. A Server that both accepts inbound connections and establishes outbound connections to other Servers MUST conform as both an MQTT Client and MQTT Server [MQTT-7.0.0-1 ].

Conformant implementations MUST NOT require the use of any extensions defined outside of this specification in order to interoperate with any other conformant implementation [MQTT-7.0.0-2 ].
