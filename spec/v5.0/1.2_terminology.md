# 1.2 Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this specification are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119 [\[RFC2119\]](#RFC2119), except where they appear in text that is marked as non-normative.

**Network Connection:**

A construct provided by the underlying transport protocol that is being used by MQTT.

- It connects the Client to the Server.
- It provides the means to send an ordered, lossless, stream of bytes in both directions.

Refer to [section 4.2](4.2_network-connections.md) Network Connection for non-normative examples.

**Application Message:**

The data carried by the MQTT protocol across the network for the application. When an Application Message is transported by MQTT it contains payload data, a Quality of Service (QoS), a collection of Properties, and a Topic Name.

**Client:**

A program or device that uses MQTT. A Client:

- opens the Network Connection to the Server
- publishes Application Messages that other Clients might be interested in.
- subscribes to request Application Messages that it is interested in receiving.
- unsubscribes to remove a request for Application Messages.
- closes the Network Connection to the Server.

**Server:**

A program or device that acts as an intermediary between Clients which publish Application Messages and Clients which have made Subscriptions. A Server:

- accepts Network Connections from Clients.
- accepts Application Messages published by Clients.
- processes Subscribe and Unsubscribe requests from Clients.
- forwards Application Messages that match Client Subscriptions.
- closes the Network Connection from the Client.

**Session:**

A stateful interaction between a Client and a Server. Some Sessions last only as long as the Network Connection, others can span multiple consecutive Network Connections between a Client and a Server.

**Subscription:**

A Subscription comprises a Topic Filter and a maximum QoS. A Subscription is associated with a single Session. A Session can contain more than one Subscription. Each Subscription within a Session has a different Topic Filter.

**Shared Subscription:**

A Shared Subscription comprises a Topic Filter and a maximum QoS. A Shared Subscription can be associated with more than one Session to allow a wider range of message exchange patterns. An Application Message that matches a Shared Subscription is only sent to the Client associated with one of these Sessions. A Session can subscribe to more than one Shared Subscription and can contain both Shared Subscriptions and Subscriptions which are not shared.

**Wildcard Subscription:**

A Wildcard Subscription is a Subscription with a Topic Filter containing one or more wildcard characters. This allows the subscription to match more than one Topic Name. Refer to [section 4.7](4.7_topic-names-and-filters.md) for a description of wildcard characters in a Topic Filter.

**Topic Name:**

The label attached to an Application Message which is matched against the Subscriptions known to the Server.

**Topic Filter:**

An expression contained in a Subscription to indicate an interest in one or more topics. A Topic Filter can include wildcard characters.

**MQTT Control Packet:**

A packet of information that is sent across the Network Connection. The MQTT specification defines fifteen different types of MQTT Control Packet, for example the PUBLISH packet is used to convey Application Messages.

**Malformed Packet:**

A control packet that cannot be parsed according to this specification. Refer to [section 4.13](4.13_handling-errors.md) for information about error handling.

**Protocol Error:**

An error that is detected after the packet has been parsed and found to contain data that is not allowed by the protocol or is inconsistent with the state of the Client or Server. Refer to [section 4.13](4.13_handling-errors.md) for information about error handling.

**Will Message:**

An Application Message which is published by the Server after the Network Connection is closed in cases where the Network Connection is not closed normally. Refer to [section 3.1.2.5](3.1_connect.md#3125-will-flag) for information about Will Messages.

**Disallowed Unicode code point:**

The set of Unicode Control Codes and Unicode Noncharacters which should not be included in a UTF-8 Encoded String. Refer to [section 1.5.4](1.5_data-representation.md#154-utf-8-encoded-string) for more information about the Disallowed Unicode code points.
