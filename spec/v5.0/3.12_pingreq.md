## 3.12 PINGREQ – PING request

The PINGREQ packet is sent from a Client to the Server. It can be used to:

- Indicate to the Server that the Client is alive in the absence of any other MQTT Control Packets being sent from the Client to the Server.

- Request that the Server responds to confirm that it is alive.

- Exercise the network to indicate that the Network Connection is active.

This packet is used in Keep Alive processing. Refer to [section 3.1.2.10](3.1_connect.md#31210-keep-alive) for more details.
