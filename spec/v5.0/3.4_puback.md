**Remaining Length field**

This is the length of the Variable Header, encoded as a Variable Byte Integer.

## 3.4.2 PUBACK Variable Header

The Variable Header of the PUBACK Packet contains the following fields in the order: Packet Identifier from the PUBLISH packet that is being acknowledged, PUBACK Reason Code, Property Length, and the Properties. The rules for encoding Properties are described in [section 2.2.2](./2.2_mqtt-control-packet-format.md#222-properties).

### 3.4.2.1 PUBACK Reason Code

Byte 3 in the Variable Header is the PUBACK Reason Code. If the Remaining Length is 2, then there is no Reason Code and the value of 0x00 (Success) is used.

| 128       | 0x80    | Unspecified error             | The receiver does not accept the publish but either does not want to reveal the reason, or it does not match one of the other values.                                                                     |

The Client or Server sending the PUBACK packet MUST use one of the PUBACK Reason Codes [MQTT-3.4.2-1]. The Reason Code and Property Length can be omitted if the Reason Code is 0x00 (Success) and there are no Properties. In this case the PUBACK has a Remaining Length of 2.

### 3.4.2.2 PUBACK Properties

#### 3.4.2.2.1 Property Length

The length of the Properties in the PUBACK packet Variable Header encoded as a Variable Byte Integer. If the Remaining Length is less than 4 there is no Property Length and the value of 0 is used.

#### 3.4.2.2.2 Reason String

**31 (0x1F) Byte**, Identifier of the Reason String.

Followed by the UTF-8 Encoded String representing the reason associated with this response. This Reason String is a human readable string designed for diagnostics and is not intended to be parsed by the receiver.

The sender uses this value to give additional information to the receiver. The sender MUST NOT send this property if it would increase the size of the PUBACK packet beyond the Maximum Packet Size specified by the receiver [MQTT-3.4.2-2]. It is a Protocol Error to include the Reason String more than once.

#### 3.4.2.2.3 User Property

**38 (0x26) Byte,** Identifier of the User Property.

Followed by UTF-8 String Pair. This property can be used to provide additional diagnostic or other information. The sender MUST NOT send this property if it would increase the size of the PUBACK packet beyond the Maximum Packet Size specified by the receiver [MQTT-3.4.2-3]. The User Property is allowed to appear multiple times to represent multiple name, value pairs. The same name is allowed to appear more than once.

## 3.4.3 PUBACK Payload

The PUBACK packet has no Payload.

## 3.4.4 PUBACK Actions

This is described in [section 4.3.2](./4.3_quality-of-service-levels-and-protocol-flows.md#432-qos-1-at-least-once-delivery).
