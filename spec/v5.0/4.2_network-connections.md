# 4.2 Network Connections

The MQTT protocol requires an underlying transport that provides an ordered, lossless, stream of bytes from the Client to Server and Server to Client. This specification does not require the support of any specific transport protocol. A Client or Server MAY support any of the transport protocols listed here, or any other transport protocol that meets the requirements of this section.

A Client or Server MUST support the use of one or more underlying transport protocols that provide an ordered, lossless, stream of bytes from the Client to Server and Server to Client \[MQTT-4.2-1\].

**Non-normative comment**

TCP/IP as defined in [\[RFC0793\]](#RFC793) can be used for MQTT v5.0. The following transport protocols are also suitable:

- TLS [\[RFC5246\]](#RFC5246)[](#RFC5246)

- WebSocket [\[RFC6455\]](#RFC6455)[](#RFC6455)

**Non-normative comment**

TCP ports 8883 and 1883 are registered with IANA for MQTT TLS and non-TLS communication respectively.

**Non-normative comment**

Connectionless network transports such as [User Datagram Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) (UDP) are not suitable on their own because they might lose or reorder data.
