## 4.5 Message receipt

When a Server takes ownership of an incoming Application Message it MUST add it to the Session State for those Clients that have matching Subscriptions \[MQTT-4.5.0-1\]. Matching rules are defined in [section 4.7](4.7_topic-names-and-filters.md).

Under normal circumstances Clients receive messages in response to Subscriptions they have created. A Client could also receive messages that do not match any of its explicit Subscriptions. This can happen if the Server automatically assigned a subscription to the Client. A Client could also receive messages while an UNSUBSCRIBE operation is in progress. The Client MUST acknowledge any Publish packet it receives according to the applicable QoS rules regardless of whether it elects to process the Application Message that it contains \[MQTT-4.5.0-2\].
