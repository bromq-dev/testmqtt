# 5.1 Introduction

MQTT is a transport protocol specification for message transmission, allowing implementers a choice of network, privacy, authentication and authorization technologies. Since the exact security technologies chosen will be context specific, it is the implementer's responsibility to include the appropriate features as part of their design.

MQTT Implementations will likely need to keep pace with an evolving security landscape.

This Chapter provides general implementation guidance so as not to restrict choices available and is therefore non-normative. This should not detract from its importance.

It is strongly recommended that Server implementations that offer TLS [\[RFC5246\]](#RFC5246) should use TCP port 8883 (IANA service name: secure-mqtt).

There are a number of threats that solution providers should consider. For example:

- Devices could be compromised
- Data at rest in Clients and Servers might be accessible
- Protocol behaviors could have side effects (e.g. `timing attacks`)
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Communications could be intercepted, altered, re-routed or disclosed
- Injection of spoofed MQTT Control Packets

MQTT solutions are often deployed in hostile communication environments. In such cases, implementations will often need to provide mechanisms for:

- Authentication of users and devices
- Authorization of access to Server resources
- Integrity of MQTT Control Packets and application data contained therein
- Privacy of MQTT Control Packets and application data contained therein

In addition to technical security issues there could also be geographic (e.g. U.S.-EU Privacy Shield Framework [\[USEUPRIVSH\]](#USEUPRIVSH)), industry specific (e.g. PCI DSS [\[PCIDSS\]](#PCIDSS)) and regulatory considerations (e.g. Sarbanes-Oxley [\[SARBANES\]](#SARBANES)).
