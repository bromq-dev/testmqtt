# 5.3 Lightweight crytography and constrained devices

Advanced Encryption Standard [\[AES\]](#AES) is the most widely adopted encryption algorithm. There is hardware support for AES in many processors, but not commonly for embedded processors. The encryption algorithm ChaCha20 \[[CHACHA20](#CHACHA20)\] encrypts and decrypts much faster in software, but is not as widely available as AES.

ISO 29192 [\[ISO29192\]](#ISO29192) makes recommendations for cryptographic primitives specifically tuned to perform on constrained `low end` devices.
